	<h1>CSS Examples</h1>
	<p>
		This sandbox contains reference examples for a number
		of CSS implementations that I find useful. In some cases
		they are adapted from real projects. In other cases, they
		are taken from books or articles where it seemed like they
		would be helpful to have in the reference list.
	</p>

	<p>Where I have borrowed from someone else, I will provide
		a citation for the source - both for giving credit, and so
		you can go get more detail if you find the example helpful
		but want more explanation</p>

	<h2>Browser Reset / Normalization</h2>
	<p>Historically, I've tended to use Eric Meyer's reset.css on
		projects, but there's a good case to be made that Normalize.css
		gives better future proofing at a trivial cost in additional
		payload. Some FEDs argue that it nets out to a smaller payload
		because you no longer have to re-implement the base styles that
		reset.css wipes out. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6887336/what-is-the-difference-between-normalize-css-and-reset-css">this
			thread on stackoverflow.com</a> if you want more details.</p>
